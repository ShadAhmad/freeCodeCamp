# Break Control Statement

Break is generally used to terminate the execution of the loop or to get out of a switch case. It helps in preventing unnecssary CPU time wastage and gives more efficient performance of a program. 
In switch case, at the end of each case, we use break statement to terminate the execution of switch and transfer the control to the statement next to the end of entire switch cases.

```java
//switch case
int c = 2;
switch(c)
{
    //1st case
    case 1: System.out.println("The value of c is "+c);
            System.out.println("This is first switch case");
            break; //This will prevent the execution of statement futher inside the switch, 
                    //otherwise case 2 would also have been executed
    //2nd case
    case 2: System.out.println("This is second switch case with value "+c);
            break;
 }
 System.out.println("This is outside switch case");//Control is transferred here as it executes the break statement
 ```
            
Terminates the loop and starts the execution of the code that immediately follows the loop. If you have nested loops, the `break` statement will only end the loop in which it is placed.

```java
// Loop 1
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{     
    // Loop 2
    for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++)
    {
        if (i == 5 && j == 5)
        {
            break; // Will terminate Loop 2, but Loop 1 will keep going
        }
    }
}
```

But if you do want to break out of the outer loop too, you can use a label to exit:

```java
loop1: // This is a label
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{    
    // Loop 2
    for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++)
    {         
        if (i == 5 && j == 5)
        {
            break loop1; // Will break out of Loop 1, instead of Loop 2
        }
    }
}
```

`break` statements can be particulary useful while searching for an element in an array. Using `break` in the following code improves efficiency as the loop stops as soon as the element we are looking for (`searchFor`) is found, instead of going on till the end of `arrayInts` is reached.

```java
int j = 0;
int[] arrayOfInts = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
int searchFor = 5;

for (int i : arrayOfInts)
{
    if (arrayOfInts[j] == searchFor)
    {
        break;
    }
    j++;
}

System.out.println("j = " + j);
```
Break statement can also be used under while statement.
```java
int i = 0;
int[] arrayOfInts = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
int searchFor = 5;

while(i < 10){
 System.out.println("i = " + j);
 if(arrayOfInts[i] > 7){
  break;
  }
}
```
